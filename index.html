		<p>On this webpage I used the background property radial-gradient, which allows you to set your background color to be as many different colors as you want. A gradient is technically another type of image, the difference is that the browser makes this image for you with all the colors you select. My example only uses one gradient, but you can layer multiple gradients on top of one another.</p>

        <p>Also, I used the scrolling div example we went over in class. However, I did it the opposite way so that my radial gradient div will uncover a picture of a sunset with like colors. To do this, i set the second div to a fixed position so that it would not move when scrolling, and appear to be under the first div.</p>
